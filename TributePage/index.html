            <h3 id="headline">A Timeline of Dr. Turing's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>1912 </strong>- Alan Mathison Turing born in Maida Vale, London, to Ethel Sara Turing (nee Stoney) and Julius Mathison Turing.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1927-1930</strong> - Alan furthers his love of science and maths by reading Einstein whilst at Sherborne.</li>
                <li><strong>1934</strong> - Alan graduates with distinction in Mathematics from King's College, Cambridge.</li>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> - Alan goes to Princeton University in America to study mathematics and is awarded a PhD.</li>
                <li><strong>1939</strong> - Alan is asked to join the war effort at Bletchley Park.</li>
                <li><strong>1940</strong> - With Gordon Welchman, Alan develops the Bombe to decipher the messages sent by the German Engima machine.</li>
                <li><strong>1945</strong> - Alan is awarded the OBE for his wartime services.</li>
                <li><strong>1946</strong> - Alan publishes a paper with the first design of the stored-program computer.</li>
                <li><strong>1949</strong> - Alan is made deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester University.</li>
                <li><strong>1950</strong> - Alan publishes the paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in which he develops the Turing Test.</li>
                <li><strong>1951</strong> - Alan is elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and gives a talk about Artificial Intelligence on the BBC.</li>
                <li><strong>1952</strong> - Alan is arrested for gross indecency for being gay. His security clearance is revoked, so he cannot work. He is offered chemical treatment instead of prison, but it makes him very weak.</li>
                <li><strong>1954</strong> - Alan dies in his home from poisoning. A half-eaten apple laced with cyanide was found next to him.</li>
                <li><strong>2007</strong> - A slate sculpture of Alan is unveiled at Bletchley Park.</li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - Gordon Brown, prime minister, makes a public apology for the "appalling" treatment of Alan Turing and thousands sign a petition.</li>

            </ul>
